# Stone Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Stone Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on one of the options: Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The result of the game will be displayed on the screen.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and content of the game.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styling for the game interface.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to handle the game functionality.

## How It Works
- The game starts when the player selects one of the options (Stone, Paper, or Scissors).
- The computer randomly chooses one of the options as well.
- The player's choice and the computer's choice are compared to determine the winner.
- The result is displayed on the screen, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or if it's a tie.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the content of the game.
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for styling the game interface.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing the game logic and interactivity.
